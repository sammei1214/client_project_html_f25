    <h2>Portfolios for All Pathways</h2>
    <p>
      <b>What is a Portfolio?</b> A portfolio is a curated collection of 3-5 projects, often presented as a website. It showcases your skills, process(es), and problem-solving abilities. Your portfolio is an opportunity to highlight your growth, creativity, and unique approach to solving problems. A strong portfolio emphasizes your thinking process, storytelling, and the real-world impact of your work. Employers and clients use portfolios to assess your qualifications and determine if you’re a good fit for their team or project.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Portfolios are typically required for User Experience (UX) Design applications.</em>

    <h2>Using AI to Support Your Career Development: Sample Prompts for portfolio creation:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creating an Online Portfolio:</strong> "I want to create an online portfolio to showcase my work in [insert focus area/job topic]. Can you guide me on the best platforms to use (e.g., GitHub, Framer, personal website) and provide tips on making my portfolio visually appealing, user-friendly, and professional?"</li>
      <li><strong>Building a Personal Brand Through My Portfolio:</strong> "My portfolio should reflect my unique strengths and personal brand as a [insert focus area/job title]. How can I ensure my portfolio highlights what sets me apart from other candidates? What elements (e.g., color scheme, tone, specific projects) should I focus on to reflect my personal brand?"</li>
      <li><strong>Tailoring a Portfolio to Specific Roles:</strong> "I’m applying for roles in [insert focus area/job topic], but my portfolio currently has a wide variety of projects. How can I tailor my portfolio to appeal to a specific job description or role? What should I emphasize for different types of positions (e.g., a data analyst vs. a UX designer)?"</li>
      <li><strong>Showcasing Technical and Soft Skills:</strong> "My portfolio includes both technical work (e.g., coding, data analysis) and soft skills (e.g., communication, project management). How can I balance showcasing both types of skills effectively? What are some ways to demonstrate these soft skills through my portfolio projects?"</li>
      <li><strong>Ensuring Portfolio Accessibility:</strong> "I want to make sure my portfolio is accessible to a diverse range of potential employers, including those with disabilities. How can I ensure my online portfolio adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., color contrast, screen reader compatibility) while still looking polished and professional?"</li>
      <li><strong>Gathering Testimonials or References for My Portfolio:</strong> "I’d like to include testimonials or references from professors, mentors, or colleagues in my portfolio. How can I request these effectively, and what’s the best way to incorporate them into my portfolio to provide social proof and credibility?"</li>
